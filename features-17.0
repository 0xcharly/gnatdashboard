NF-17-P303-043 Support for --dry-run (2016-03-03)

  GNAThub now supports a --dry-run switch that enables dry run mode (also known
  as "check mode"). When executed with --dry-run, GNAThub will report what
  changes it would have made and what plugins it would have executed rather
  than making and executing them. Check mode is a simulation that can be useful
  for testing the validity of a command line and project configuration without
  running the actual tools.
