GNAThub, GNATdashboard command-line driver
==========================================

GNAThub is a command-line tool that connects the dots between the GNAT Pro Tool
Suite and the GNATdashboard plugin for SonarQube. It collects and aggregates all
results from the various tools into a single place and stores those data into a
single SQLite file.


How to build the GNAThub driver
===============================

GNAThub strongly depends on GPS, so you will need a GPS Developer Environment to
be able to build the project. This step is fairly easy thanks to the GPS.env
script available in the GPS directory. This help will guide you throught the
necessary steps to get GNAThub working. For more information, please refer to
GPS.env documentation:

Fetching and building GPS
-------------------------

You will need an access to GPS main repository to execute the following
commands:

    $ mkdir GPS
    $ svn export svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/gps/design/GPS.env
    $ source GPS.env
    $ gps_world

Building GNAThub
----------------

    $ export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=$GPS_ENV_ROOT_DIR/src/gps/cli:$GPR_PROJECT_PATH
    $ cd GNAThub
    $ make

There are 2 mandatory steps before building the GNAThub driver mentions above:

    - Source the GPS.env script;
    - Update the $GPR_PROJECT_PATH environment variable to add the directory
      containing cli.gpr (for the GPS project) to the Ada project file search
      path (the $GPS_ENV_ROOT_DIR is set and exported by GPS.env).

Generating a GNAThub distribution
---------------------------------

With the mandatory environment set:

    $ make distrib
