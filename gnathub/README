GNAThub, GNATdashboard command-line driver
==========================================

GNAThub is a command-line tool that connects the dots between the GNAT Pro Tool
Suite and the GNATdashboard plugin for SonarQube. It collects and aggregates all
results from the various tools into a single place and stores those data into a
single SQLite file.
