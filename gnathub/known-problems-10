KP-10-NB27-025 Missing src_mapping property in sonar-project.properties

  Problem:    When generating sonar-project.properties for a single-module
              project, the resulting file is missing the
              sonar.ada.gnathub.src_mapping property.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.1 on 2014-11-27

  Workaround: Run all plugins but sonarrunner, patch the file by hand and
              re-run gnathub with "-i --plugins sonarrunner".

KP-10-NB20-021 Inconsistent use of -U across tools

  Problem:    GNATcheck invocation command line is lacking the -U switch, which
              forces the processing of the entire closure of source of the
              project.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.2 on 2015-02-17

  Workaround: Edit the gnatcheck.py GNAThub plugin manually to add this switch.
