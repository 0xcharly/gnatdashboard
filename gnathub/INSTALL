Building from sources
=====================

To build GNAThub from sources, you need to have GNU make available as a
prerequisite.

You need to use a recent version of the GNAT compiler (e.g. GNAT 7.1.2).

You need an install of GNATcoll to build the project.

Fetching and building GNATcoll
------------------------------

Fetch GNATcoll sources:

   $ svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/gps/gnatlib gnatcoll

Then execute the following commands:

   $ cd gnatcoll
   $ ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-shared --with-python \
        --enable-projects --with-sqlite --disable-syslog --without-gmp
   $ make all install

Building GNAThub
----------------

Once GNATcoll has been built and installed, update the GPR_PROJECT_PATH:

   $ export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/gnat:$GPR_PROJECT_PATH

Then execute the following command:

   $ cd gnatdashboard/gnathub
   $ make

Generating a GNAThub distribution
---------------------------------

You will need to follow the instructions listed above, with an additional step:

   $ make distrib
