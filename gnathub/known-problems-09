KP-09-N704-008 GNAThub crashes with switch -X

  Problem:    GNAThub raises a CONSTRAINT_ERROR when the -X switch is used
              because of a wrong module initialization order.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-07-04

  Workaround: None

KP-09-N623-022 GNAThub indexes plug-ins by the name of the Python class only

  Problem:    The name property of a plug-in is not used when selecting
              plug-ins to run, only for display (eg. in logs). This is
              confusing and users expect to use the custom name attribute to
              discriminate their plug-ins rather than the name of the Python
              class holding the implementation.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-08-14

  Workaround: Use the name of the Python class.
