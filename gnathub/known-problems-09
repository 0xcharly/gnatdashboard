GNAThub 0.9 KNOWN PROBLEMS LIST
===============================

Copyright (C) 2014, AdaCore

KP-09-N818-014 GNAThub does not display fatal errors

  Problem:    Fatal errors are logged, but not displayed on the error output.
              This can lead to cases where GNAThub would simply exit without
              notifying the user about the error.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-08-18

  Workaround: Use the log file to retrieve the error message.

KP-09-N805-033 message insertion is slow

  Problem:    Message insertion in the database is slow, in particular for
              plug-ins codepeer, gnatmetric and gcov.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-08-19

  Workaround: None

KP-09-N725-012 -X parameters are not passed to underlying tools.

  Problem:    -X switches passed to the gnathub drivers are not propagated
              to underlying project-aware tools.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-08-12

  Workaround: None

KP-09-N704-008 GNAThub crashes with switch -X

  Problem:    GNAThub raises a CONSTRAINT_ERROR when the -X switch is used
              because of a wrong module initialization order.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-07-04

  Workaround: None

KP-09-N623-022 GNAThub indexes plug-ins by the name of the Python class only

  Problem:    The name property of a plug-in is not used when selecting
              plug-ins to run, only for display (eg. in logs). This is
              confusing and users expect to use the custom name attribute to
              discriminate their plug-ins rather than the name of the Python
              class holding the implementation.

  Status:     Fixed in GNAThub 1.0.0 on 2014-08-14

  Workaround: Use the name of the Python class.
