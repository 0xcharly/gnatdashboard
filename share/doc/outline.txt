 INTRODUCTION
--------------

    GNATdashboard is a tool that helps you to process GNATtools analysis on your
    project and provides a unique interface to access the results of the analysis.
    GNATdashboard is composed of 2 components:

        - a driver: drives the tools to launch, provide python API to access
                    tools results data.

        - a plugin for Sonar: enables to use Sonar to visualize the analysis
                              results.

    Currently, GNATdashboard integrates the following tools from GNAT tool suite:
        
        - GNATmetric
        - GNATcheck
        - GNATprove
        - CodePeer
        - Gcov

    Coming soon:

        - GNATcov
        - GNATtest/AUnit
        - GNATstack

 THE DRIVER
------------

    GNATdashboard driver has four targets:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        1. centralize and automate the execution of GNAT tool suite,

        2. provide a deposit data that gathered information resulting from all the
           tools,

        3. provide a python API the access this deposit data: read & write.

        4. provide plugin system with a python API to extend the driver, in
           order to integrate your favourite tool if it is not already
           integrated.


    How to use GNATdashboard driver for your project:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Basic execution:

            $ qualimetrics -P your_project.gpr

        N.B: To be compliant with GNATcheck requirement, you need to declare a
             'check' package in your project file that defines switches to use
             for its execution. If you don't, GNATcheck will not be executed.

        In detail:
            This command will execute all the integrated tools (see above) and
            then try to run sonar-runner. If sonar-runner is nor installed on
            your computer, it should not fail the execution of
            the driver.

        Switches:
            -P project_name    Required, project on which analyse will be done.
            -q, --quiet        Output quiet mode.
            -v, --verbose      Output verbose mode.
            --plugins=ARG      Execute a list a plugins given by ARG.
                               Example: --plugins=gnatcheck,gnatmetric,sonarrunner
